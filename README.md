# Sacred Geometry Visualizer

A mesmerizing sacred geometry visualization that combines p5.js, React, and mystical patterns with inspirational messages.

## About

This visualizer creates an interactive 3D sacred geometry experience with rotating hexagons, triangular patterns, and pulsing elements, all synchronized with inspiring messages that change periodically.

## Mantra Philosophy

> THE ONLY WAY OUT IS THROUGH  
> MIGHT AS WELL DANCE WHILE DOING IT  
> JOY IS AN ACT OF RESISTANCE  
> WELCOME, SELF-DANCER  
> FRICTION CAN BE USEFUL  
> FEEL WHAT YOU'RE DANCING AGAINST  
> PERFORMING REFUSAL  
> REFUSAL TO COLLAPSE INTO LEGIBILITY  
> AND DOING IT WITH RHYTHM  

This project represents a "Tripartite Invocation" - combining visual patterns, inspirational text, and interactive elements to create a meditative, reflective experience.

## Technical Details

- Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**
- Visualization created using **p5.js** in 3D WEBGL mode
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Custom geometric algorithms for sacred geometry patterns
- Animated transitions between visual states
- Interactive elements that respond to user clicks

## Aesthetic Design

The visual style combines:
- Mystical sacred geometry patterns
- Cyberpunk/vaporwave color palette
- Minimalist typography
- Subtle animation effects (pulse, rotation, glitch)
- Voxel-style extrusions for depth
